<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project is the first assignment for the <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> course in the 
    <strong>2023-2024 academic year</strong>. In this project, I developed a <strong>Perceptron model</strong> 
    and implemented a <strong>regression example</strong> to demonstrate fundamental machine learning 
    concepts and algorithmic implementations. I used the <strong>Java</strong> language in this project.
